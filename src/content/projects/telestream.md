After the IoT project was dismissed, I transitioned to a new team, which included some members from the previous team, to work on a new project. This time, we were tasked with designing an architecture to deploy virtual machines on the Microsoft Azure cloud, running [Telestream](https://www.telestream.net/) software and ensuring inter-machine communication through a virtual network.

This project provided me with invaluable experience in engaging with technical clients, as I had the opportunity to discuss features directly with the client's CTO. This direct interaction was a significant milestone for me. Fortunately, the client's team was very supportive and open to making necessary software adjustments, facilitating smooth project progress.

Additionally, I gained leadership experience by being the primary point of contact for technical discussions. With more context on the project than my teammates, I shared knowledge and created accessible documentation, significantly enhancing my contribution to the team.

Upon meeting the project deadline, our results exceeded expectations, earning congratulations from both the client and our company, marking a successful and educational endeavor.
