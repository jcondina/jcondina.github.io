After the IoT project got dismissed, I transitioned to a new team which included some of the last team’s members to work on a new project. This time, the project was about designing an architecture to spin up virtual machines on Microsoft Azure cloud. The main goal was to be able to run some [Telestream](https://www.telestream.net/) software across the machines and ensure they were able to communicate with each other using a virtual network.

This was a project where I started gaining some real experience on dealing with technical clients since I was able to discuss features directly with the client’s CTO and that was a big win for me. Luckily, the client’s team was very supportive and were willing to make changes in their software if needed so that the project could make progress smoothly.

I was also able to gain some leadership experience in this project too, since I was the only one who had these technical discussions and I had more context in the matter than other members of the team. Being able to share that information and create documentation so that it would be easily accessed made a significant impact on my own impact on the team.

When the project met its deadline, the results were better than the expected and we were congratulated by both the client and our own company.
