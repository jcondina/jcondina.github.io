Following the Azure Deployment Web Application project, I transitioned to a dynamic IoT test project, tasked with crafting an application and dashboard utilizing Python, C, Azure Function, and PowerBI, evoking fond memories of my college days studying Electronics Engineering as we immersed ourselves in the realm of geolocation devices and sensor simulations, reveling in the joy of experimenting with test boards, LEDs, and a myriad of colorful cables to capture and process data for our project.

The camaraderie within the team, enriched by shared backgrounds in electronics, fostered seamless collaboration as we navigated the intricacies of creating diagrams, testing functionalities, and transforming raw data into actionable insights, making what could have been mundane tasks into enjoyable endeavors.

This project also served as a catalyst for honing my soft skills, particularly in seeking assistance with unfamiliar concepts like DAX, the language utilized by PowerBI, where a colleague affectionately dubbed "The DAX god" generously imparted his expertise, teaching me not only the technical intricacies but also invaluable lessons in effective cross-team communication and the importance of seeking guidance when needed, dispelling the notion that asking for help is a sign of weakness in the developer community.

Although the project ultimately did not come to fruition due to the client's disinterest, the invaluable lessons learned, both technically and interpersonally, serve as enduring pillars of growth and development in my journey as a developer.
